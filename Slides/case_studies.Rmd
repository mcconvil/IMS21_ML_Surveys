.orange2[Why should we not use linear regression?]

--

* We have mostly categorical variables with many categories.

--

* The industry code is likely important and most job types probably only fall into a few of the industries.

--

* Additive model is too simple and the fully interactive is too complex with not enough data in many sub-groups.

At each end node, the estimator is given by the .orange2[survey-weighted mean].

### The Regression Tree Estimator

$$\hat{t}_y = \sum_{i \in U} \hat{m}(\boldsymbol{x_i}) + \sum_{i \in s} \frac{y_i - \hat{m}(\boldsymbol{x_i})}{\pi_i}$$

Let $Q = \{ B_{1}, B_{2}, \ldots, B_{q} \}$ be the of partitioning boxes from the tree.

--

For $\boldsymbol{x} \in B_k$:

\begin{align*}
    \hat{m}({\boldsymbol x})=
   \widehat{\#}(B_{k})^{-1} \sum_{i \in s} \pi_{i}^{-1} y_i I ({\boldsymbol x}_i \in B_{k})
\end{align*}

where

\begin{align*}
   \widehat{\#}(B_{k}) = \sum_{i \in s} \pi_{i}^{-1} I ({\boldsymbol x}_i \in B_{k}).
\end{align*}

---

### The Regression Tree Estimator

* Splits are selected based on a permutation test.

* Tree stops splitting based on a p-value threshold or minimum end node size.

* R package for regression trees built on complex survey data: [rpms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpms/index.html)

### The Regression Tree Estimator

#### Calibration

Can linearize the trees:

$$\hat{m}({\bf x}) = \tilde{\mu}_{n1}  I({\bf x} \in B_{n1}) + \tilde{\mu}_{n2} I({\bf x} \in B_{n2}) + \ldots + \tilde{\mu}_{nq}  I({\bf x} \in B_{nq})$$

--


* Regression tree is .orange2[calibrated] to population totals of the end nodes:

$$\sum_{j \in U} I({ \bf x}_j \in B_{nk}) =   \sum_{j \in s} \tilde{w}_j I({ \bf x}_j \in B_{nk})$$


----   

--


#### Post-stratification

* Post-stratified estimator: Generalized regression estimator where the assisting model is the group mean model

--

* Regression tree estimator: End nodes of the tree are a set of .orange2[predictive] post-strata!

### General Thoughts on Selecting the Model

--

#### Consider your audience.

--

#### Figure out what data you have access to.

--

#### Do lots of exploratory data analysis.

--


#### Analyze the resulting survey weights.
